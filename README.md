about me

I'm learn web developer skill by self-tought, I was gradiuted by economy brachelor, however, after two years working and a unexpected thought of learning coding to be more productive on my working, I was getting encourged and charmed by the world of computer.

After a struggle of the pain of new life and chasing what I really want to be. I decided to quit the job and get involved in the web development world.

Learning comes with pain, however, all i could feel achieveness. I learned vallina html, css and javascript all on the Internet and the tech books in the past one year and I felt proud of my hardworking.

I love coding. It's so amazing to me and it makes felt like the world is changing because of it.


roadmap

html  starting from the headfirst of html and css. understand semantic html
css   get involved in css3, animation and transition makes web so much amazing. video and audio makes the world never easier for listern and hearing.
js   all core is about js, I love verniaa js, functional programming and oop programing, instead of the using framework or Jquery, it makes me felt like what the language is doing under the hook and i love to create my wheel to felt the underly of the world
express on Node  not only fell satified on the basic knowledge, I love to understand the whole package of the web development, understading how data interacte between backend and front end and it give me a more clear and smart understanding on how xhr / ajax works. trying to make the server by my own with MVC design pattern improved me a lot on orgnizing on code and deep thinking on data strcture
react --- react, react router, readux, a modern front end framework, let me get more encouraged idea how spa works and how productive it could be.
graphql -- current known graphql, it released a lot pain on restful API and save my work on setting frozon key and data filter when needed.
