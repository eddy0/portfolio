my own portolio


about me

    - I was graduated for the degree of an economy bachelor. However, after a year's working and due to a whim of learning code in order to to be more productive on my job, I was then impressed on how amazing coding is and felt like it is changing the world!
    - After struggling between the peaceful of current life or chasing what I really want to be, I quit the previous job and started to be involved with my web developer learning career.
    - I learned HTML, CSS and valina Javascript, and React on online resource (udemey, youtube) and the tech books.Learning always comes with challenge and pain, especially the new world. However, all I could feel is exciting and the sense of accomplishment when I write a project or demo.
               


roadmap

html  starting from the headfirst of html and css. understand semantic html
css   get involved in css3, animation and transition makes web so much amazing. video and audio makes the world never easier for listern and hearing.
js   all core is about js, I love verniaa js, functional programming and oop programing, instead of the using framework or Jquery, it makes me felt like what the language is doing under the hook and i love to create my wheel to felt the underly of the world
express on Node  not only fell satified on the basic knowledge, I love to understand the whole package of the web development, understading how data interacte between backend and front end and it give me a more clear and smart understanding on how xhr / ajax works. trying to make the server by my own with MVC design pattern improved me a lot on orgnizing on code and deep thinking on data strcture
react --- react, react router, readux, a modern front end framework, let me get more encouraged idea how spa works and how productive it could be.
graphql -- current known graphql, it released a lot pain on restful API and save my work on setting frozon key and data filter when needed.
